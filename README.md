# Rehema Academy Database Project

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This SQL project models the database of Rehema Academy, a fictional school. It captures information about students, parents, teachers, subjects, classes, academic performance, events in the school and teacher-subject assignments. The schema ensures data integrity using constraints and enforces relationships through foreign keys.

### âœ… Key Features
- Tables with primary, foreign key, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE constraints
- Proper implementation of 1:1, 1:M, and M:M relationships
- Prepopulated data for testing and analysis (e.g., 85 students, 8 teachers, 80 parents)
